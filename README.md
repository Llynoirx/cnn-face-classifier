Kaggle Challenge: Face Classification and Verification with Convolutional Neural Networks

In this challenge, the task of identifying a person's face from an image is referred to as face classification. The system will receive a face image as input and must predict the corresponding ID. The training data includes ground truth labels, and the network will perform N-way classification to generate its predictions. A validation set is also provided for fine-tuning the model.
